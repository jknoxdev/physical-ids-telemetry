## What is LIMA?

LIMA nodes are small, battery-powered sensors that detect physical integrity events — door opens, enclosure breaches, vehicle towing, cabinet punctures — and deliver cryptographically signed alerts to a local gateway, which routes them to operators via push notification, SIEM, or cloud audit trail.

The system is designed to be **air-gapped first**. No cloud dependency for core operation. No persistent BLE connections. No trusted local network required. Just a node, a gateway, and a signed audit trail that survives internet outages.

## System Overview
![overview](docs/architecture/overview.png)

**Two independent threat models, one pipeline:**

| Trigger | Use Case | Sensor |
|---|---|---|
| `PRESSURE_BREACH` | Cabinet puncture, enclosure door open, seal broken | BMP280 barometric |
| `MOTION_DETECTED` | Vehicle tow, rack movement, vibration attack | MPU6050 IMU |
| `DUAL_BREACH` | Full physical intrusion — moved AND breached | Both |

Each fires independently. An attacker must defeat both sensors simultaneously to avoid detection.

## Hardware

| Component | Part | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Edge Node | Nordic nRF52840 MDK USB Dongle | Sensor + crypto + BLE |
| IMU | MPU6050 | Motion / vibration detection |
| Barometric | BMP280 | Pressure delta detection |
| Crypto | CryptoCell-310 (on-die) | ECDSA-P256 hardware signing |
| Gateway | Raspberry Pi Zero | BLE scanner + MQTT broker |

## Bench Prototyping & Logic Validation

> **Current Phase:** Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing of the core FSM and I2C driver resilience.

![LIMA Bench Validation](docs/media/initial-fsm.gif)

### Validation Goals
* **Bus Resilience:** Confirmed the I2C recovery sequence (9-clock pulse) restores sensor comms after a simulated bus hang.
* **State Mapping:** RGB status telemetry correctly reflects transitions from `ARMED` to `EVENT_DETECTED`.
* **Async Handling:** Verified that high-frequency sensor polling (Prio 6) correctly feeds the FSM dispatch (Prio 5) without blocking.

## Security Design

- **Every event is signed & encrypted** — ECDSA-P256 via CryptoCell-310 hardware accelerator (~50ms, minimal power)
- **Per-event nonce** — prevents replay attacks
- **Tamper events are first-class** — a failed signature verification is itself logged and alerted
- **SQLite written first** — audit trail is intact regardless of internet connectivity
- **Queue-and-flush** — events survive gateway internet outages, delivered on reconnect
- **Air-gapped core** — no cloud dependency for detection, signing, or local audit

```bash
# 1. Initialize workspace
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install west
west init -l lima-node
west update

# 2. Install SDK requirements
pip install -r zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
pip install -r nrf/scripts/requirements.txt

# 3. Build
west build -b nrf52840_mdk_usb_dongle/nrf52840 lima-node/firmware \
  -- -DCONFIG_BUILD_OUTPUT_UF2=y

# 4. Flash (dongle in bootloader mode)
west flash
```
